# IDEA
The main idea here is to get every payment platform at one place and track expenses done through each indivudial platform at one place for easy management. This project gives you a list of every expense along with the platform this is done trough. It will help the person manage their expenses and spendings efficiently. We can also give a section showing all the cashback rewards earned by the customer. A notification system which will remind user that their cashback coupon is going to expire soon as many-a-times we lose track of them and they get wasted.
